# WildBrowser
A browser that translate any Japanese website into a "wild" way.

## What is it?
This is a demo for a browser which you can replace any matching words into arbitrary ones.
It works for Japanese only, but you can easily support other languages by replacing "wild.txt" into your preferred languages.

### Browser mode
It will show website just as a normal browser, except it will change some of the word ending with "ぜぇ〜。ワイルドだろぉ～"

### Text mode
Enter any Japanese sentences. It will do the same transformation as the Browser mode.
