# Fake Browser
A browser (and a text converter) that turns predefined words into different words.

## What is it?
This is a demo iOS app which you can replace words based on the predefined dictionary.
It works in Japanese only, but you can easily support other languages by replacing "fake.txt" with your preferred languages.

The look and feel of the website will stay the same, but only the texts will be changed, thus "Fake Browser".

### Browser mode
It will show websites just like normal browsers, except it will change some of the word endings with "ぜぇ〜。ワイルドだろぉ～"

### Text mode
Enter any Japanese sentences. It will do the same transformation as the Browser mode.
