# WildBrowser
A browser and a converter that replace any Japanese text in a "wild" way.

## What is it?
This is a demo app which you can replace predefined words with arbitrary ones.
It works in Japanese only, but you can easily support other languages by replacing "wild.txt" with your preferred languages.

### Browser mode
It will show websites just like normal browsers, except it will change some of the word endings with "ぜぇ〜。ワイルドだろぉ～"

### Text mode
Enter any Japanese sentences. It will do the same transformation as the Browser mode.
